```

> Done!

### Pypi

> This tool is also available to download with the Python Package Index (PyPi). We will install the package by executing the following command

```shell

## Features
-	Using the example file (NRsim.py) we will use this toolbox to generate 5G waveform and some other interesting graphics. More precisely, this toolbox generate:
	- Constellation of the received and transmitted symbols.
	- Histogram of the received samples.
	- Power Spectral Density of the received and transmitted signal.
	- Subcarriers received and transmitted.
	- Signal in time domain.
## Usage
- You can use your own script that calls all the functions implemented in the toolbox but you are welcome to use the example file that is uploaded in this repo. All you need to have is 3.7 Python version installed!

## Donations (Optional)

- You could include a <a href="https://cdn.rawgit.com/gratipay/gratipay-badge/2.3.0/dist/gratipay.png" target="_blank">Gratipay</a> link as well.
